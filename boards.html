1. Demonstrate and communicate aesthetic skills and choices based on traditional art theory, current game development
practices and next-generation research.
2. Conceptualize and generate pre-production art assets through pre-visualization and prototypes usable for multiple game
platforms.
3. Demonstrate a cross-section of baseline skills needed to create 2D and 3D art, textures and animation assets utilizing
industry-standard software tools.
4. Demonstrate the ability to build industry-quality game assets specializing in specific 2D and/or 3D art and/or animations
utilizing industry-standard software tools, pipelines and platform guidelines.
5. Adapt, export, integrate, and optimize game art and animation assets (including shaders and lighting) into 2D and 3D
game projects working within a production pipeline and the confines of a projectâ€™s game engine, tools and other
constraints.
6. Establish collaboration, mentorship and professional leadership skills by working with other disciplines to deliver highly
polished and completed projects.
